Classifying movie reviews: A binary classification example

**Aim**
We will learn to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.

**The IMDB dataset**
We’ll work with the IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They’re split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.

This dataset comes packaged with Keras and has already been preprocessed: the reviews (sequences of words) have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary. This enables us to focus on model building, training, and evaluation.
